                    <h3>Joker</h3>
                    <p>Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives in Gotham with his mother, and his only motivation in life is to make people laugh. He acts as a clown in small jobs, but he has mental problems that make people see him as a freak. His great dream is to act as a comedian in front of the public, but a series of tragic events will make him increase his anger against a society that ignores him.</p>
